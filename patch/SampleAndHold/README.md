# Sample and Hold

## Author

Ben Sergentanis

## Description 
Dual Sample and hold or Track and hold module. Each individual circuit can be set to one of these two modes.  
Sample and hold samples, or stores the incoming signal on the rising edge of a gate or trigger.  
In other words, it only updates once per trigger.  
Track and Hold will continue tracking, or updating, as long as the gate is held high.
