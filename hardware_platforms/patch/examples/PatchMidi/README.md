# Keyboard Test

SW 1 and SW 2 function as octave up/down buttons

All 13 of the keyboard buttons work as a chromatic keyboard with 13-note polyphony.

oscillators are each Bandlimited Saw waves

SW 3 enables/disables the reverb.

## building

Currently for some reason this only works when built with VisualStudio/VisualGDB..

It builds correctly with Make, but doesn't run. Likely just something not being correctly included with Make or something.
