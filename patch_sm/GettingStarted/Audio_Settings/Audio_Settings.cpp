/** Callback for processing and synthesizing audio
 *
 *  The audio buffers are arranged as arrays of samples for each channel.
 *  For example, to access the left input you would use:
 *    in[0][n]
 *  where n is the specific sample.
 *  There are "size" samples in each array.
 *
 *  The default size is very small (just 4 samples per channel). This means the
 * callback is being called at 16kHz.
 *
 *  This size is acceptable for many applications, and provides an extremely low
 * latency from input to output. However, you can change this size by calling
 * hw.SetAudioBlockSize(desired_size). When running complex DSP it can be more
 * efficient to do the processing on larger chunks at a time.
